I'm just starting my journey into accessibility, it seems to be a topic that concerns me, so I'm sharing with you.



If you still don't know what it is and why it's important, I recommend watching the Episode 7 of 4th season "Sex Education", even if you don't watch the series itself, this episod is all about that.



Our app 9292 can be considered quite good in terms of accessibility. A couple years ago, the company conducted research on this topic: they invited people with various disabilities, researched how they use UI, and how it could be improved in terms of accessibility. Now we just try to support this while creating new features.



Fun fact: since I've been working on accessibility for the last few days, I turned on VoiceOver on the test device to check something. So the phone have been staying in this mode for a while. Just imagine, it's the weekend, silence in the morning, and suddenly a male voice began to read messages from Slack from the office room (I receive notifications from Crashlytics in Slack) and all notifications are unnounced aloud with VoiceOver mode. It was unexpected and a bit creepy!
